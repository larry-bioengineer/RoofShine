# Project RoofShine :sunny:

## :thought_balloon: Background
[For most people, the road to solar power is paved with questions: about affordability, weather and light patterns, usable roof area, angle and tilt, government incentives.](https://sustainability.google/projects/project-sunroof/) This investigation is usually done by hiring a local solar rooftop installer or an auditor for a solar panel quotation, which can be troublesome and sometimes expensive, creating a much higher barrier to persuade people to install solar panel. 

The goal of this project is to automize the process by using image recognition software to analyze these factors. 

### Factor to be analyzed 
- Rooftop size
- Annual sunshine on the spot
- Possible shading on the roof
